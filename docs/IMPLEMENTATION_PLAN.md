## Testing Strategy

### Desktop Unit Testing (Phase 0: Continuous, Weeks 1-12)

**Primary Testing Approach:**
- Desktop tests execute **first** on every code change
- Fast feedback loop (test suite executes in <60 seconds)
- Run locally by developers before commit
- Run automatically in CI/CD on every push
- **Gate mobile builds:** Mobile compilation/testing only proceeds if desktop tests pass

**Coverage Targets:**
- ≥80% code coverage of shared library (`src/shared/`)
- ≥95% of core algorithm code in shared library
- 100% of critical algorithms covered by unit tests

**Test Scope:**
- Pitch detection algorithm (autocorrelation, NSDF, frequency extraction, note mapping)
- Tone generation algorithm (sine synthesis, frequency calculation, phase accumulation)
- Frequency calculations (equal temperament, cent deviation, octave relationships)
- Configuration management (reference pitch storage, retrieval, validation)
- Signal validation (amplitude thresholds, confidence scoring)

**Test Infrastructure:**
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Test Framework:** Catch2 or Google Test
- **Mock Platform Services:** MockAudioInput, MockAudioOutput, MockConfigStorage, MockPermissions
- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows (developer workstations + CI runners)

**Execution:**
1. Developer writes feature code in `src/shared/`
2. Developer writes unit tests in `tests/unit/`
3. Developer runs `make test` locally
4. Developer commits code
5. CI/CD runs desktop test suite
6. If tests pass → CI proceeds to mobile builds
7. If tests fail → CI stops, notifies developer, blocks merge

**Metrics:**
- Test execution time: <60 seconds (target: <30 seconds)
- Code coverage: ≥80% of shared library
