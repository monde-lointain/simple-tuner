## 7. Internationalization and Localization Requirements

**Version 1.0 of the Chromatic Tuner application targets English-language users exclusively. This section defines internationalization and localization requirements for the initial release and establishes the foundation for future multi-language support.**

### 7.1 Version 1.0 Language Support

**IL-001: English-Only Release**  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Requirement:** Version 1.0 shall provide user interface text, help documentation, and app store metadata exclusively in English (United States).

**Justification:**
- Focused scope for timely release
- Volunteer development resources limited
- Music terminology (note names) largely universal using English letters

**IL-002: Note Name Internationalization**  
**Priority:** N/A  
**Requirement:** Note names (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C#, D#, F#, G#, A#) shall use English letter notation consistently, as this is the internationally recognized standard for chromatic note naming in music education and performance.

**Exception:** Future localized versions may optionally include local note naming conventions where they differ significantly (e.g., German H for B, Latin solfège Do-Re-Mi), but this is not required.

**IL-003: Numeric Format**  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Requirement:** Numeric displays shall use conventions appropriate for international audiences:
- **Decimal separator:** Period "." (e.g., "12.3 cents", not "12,3")
- **Frequency units:** "Hz" (Hertz) is internationally recognized
- **No thousands separators:** Frequency values under 1000 Hz require no separator

**Rationale:** Music and audio engineering contexts globally use period as decimal separator.

### 7.2 Internationalization Architecture (Future-Proofing)

**IL-004: String Externalization**  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Requirement:** All user-facing text strings shall be externalized to resource files rather than hard-coded in source code, facilitating future translation without code modifications.

**Implementation:**
- iOS: Use NSLocalizedString and Localizable.strings files
- Android: Use strings.xml resource files
- JUCE: Use JUCE's TRANS() macro or equivalent localization mechanism

**Verification:**
- Code audit confirms no hard-coded English strings in UI code
- Grep for English words in C++ source files flags violations

**IL-005: Unicode Support**  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Requirement:** The application shall handle Unicode text correctly in all text fields, including UTF-8 encoding for strings and proper rendering of extended character sets.

**Rationale:** Future localizations may include non-ASCII characters (accented characters, Cyrillic, CJK).

**Verification:**
- Test display of strings containing accented characters (é, ñ, ü)
- Verify no text corruption or rendering issues

**IL-006: Layout Flexibility**  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Requirement:** User interface layouts shall accommodate text length variations up to +30% from English baseline, ensuring future localizations (e.g., German, Spanish) do not cause text truncation or layout breaking.

**Implementation:**
- Use flexible layouts (auto-layout on iOS, constraint layouts on Android)
- Avoid fixed-width text containers where possible
- Test with artificially lengthened strings

**Verification:**
- UI tested with strings extended by 30% (pseudo-localization)
- No text clipping or button overflow

**IL-007: Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Consideration**  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Requirement:** While RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew) are not planned for near-term support, the application architecture shall not preclude future RTL support. No hard-coded left-to-right layout assumptions in core design.

**Implementation:**
- Use platform layout abstractions respecting text directionality
- Avoid absolute positioning where relative positioning suffices

**IL-008: Date and Time Formatting**  
**Priority:** N/A  
**Requirement:** Version 1.0 does not display dates or times. If future versions add time-stamped data (e.g., tuning history logs), date/time formatting shall use platform localization APIs to respect user's locale settings.

**IL-009: Currency and Units**  
**Priority:** N/A  
**Requirement:** The application does not display currency (free application) or measurement units beyond musical units (Hz, cents), which are internationally standardized and do not require localization.

### 7.3 Future Localization Scope

**IL-010: Priority Languages for Future Releases**  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Requirement:** If localization is pursued in future releases, priority languages should be selected based on:
1. App store download statistics by region
2. Size of musician population
3. Languages with professional music education systems
4. Volunteer translator availability

**Suggested priorities (subject to data-driven revision):**
- **Tier 1:** Spanish, German, French, Japanese (large musician populations)
- **Tier 2:** Italian, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Russian
- **Tier 3:** Additional European and Asian languages

**IL-011: Localized Help Content**  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Requirement:** Future localizations shall include translated help documentation explaining:
- Musical terminology (note names, cents, chromatic scale)
- Reference pitch calibration
- Usage instructions

**Challenge:** Musical terminology education varies by region; help content may require cultural adaptation beyond direct translation.

**IL-012: App Store Metadata Localization**  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Requirement:** Future localizations shall include translated app store metadata:
- Application name (if translated)
- Description
- Keywords
- Screenshot captions

**IL-013: No Content Localization Required**  
**Priority:** N/A  
**Requirement:** The application contains no culture-specific content requiring localization:
- No images of people, flags, or cultural symbols
- No region-specific examples or references
- Musical notation and terminology are international

## Appendix A: Glossary

**Analog-style meter:** A visual display mimicking mechanical tuning meters with a needle or pointer moving along an arc to indicate pitch deviation, as opposed to purely numeric or bar-graph displays.

**App store:** Digital distribution platform for mobile applications (Apple App Store for iOS, Google Play Store for Android).

**A4 (A440):** The musical note A above middle C, conventionally tuned to 440 Hz as international concert pitch standard (ISO 16:1975). This frequency serves as the reference for calculating all other note frequencies in equal temperament.

**Buffer underrun:** An error condition in real-time audio processing where the audio processing thread fails to produce output samples or consume input samples within the required time deadline, resulting in audible glitches (clicks, dropouts, silence).

**Cent:** A logarithmic unit of musical interval measurement. One cent is 1/100 of an equal-tempered semitone. The formula for cents is: cents = 1200 × log₂(f₁/f₂), where f₁ and f₂ are two frequencies.

**Chromatic:** Including all twelve pitches of the equal-tempered scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B) within an octave, as opposed to diatonic (seven-note) scales.

**Clipping:** Distortion occurring when an audio signal exceeds the maximum representable amplitude (±1.0 in normalized representation), causing the waveform to be "clipped" flat at the peaks.

**Cross-platform:** Software designed to function on multiple operating system platforms (iOS and Android in this case) from a largely shared codebase, minimizing platform-specific code.

**dBFS (Decibels Full Scale):** A unit of measurement for audio levels in digital systems, where 0 dBFS represents the maximum possible amplitude before clipping, and negative values represent quieter signals (e.g., -12 dBFS is quieter than -6 dBFS).

**Equal temperament (12-tone equal temperament):** A musical tuning system dividing the octave into twelve equal intervals (semitones), where each semitone represents a frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.05946. This is the standard tuning system for most modern Western music.

**Autocorrelation:** A signal processing technique that measures the similarity of a signal with a time-shifted version of itself, used in pitch detection to identify periodic patterns corresponding to fundamental frequency.

**Foreground / Background:** Application states on mobile platforms. Foreground: Application visible on screen, receiving user input and system resources. Background: Application not visible, with limited resources and restricted functionality.

**Frequency:** The rate at which a sound wave oscillates, measured in Hertz (Hz). In music, frequency corresponds to perceived pitch: higher frequency = higher pitch.

**Fundamental frequency:** The lowest frequency component of a periodic waveform (such as a musical note). The fundamental frequency determines the perceived pitch, even though higher harmonics (overtones) are also present.

**McLeod Pitch Period Method (McLeod PPM):** A pitch detection algorithm using the Normalized Square Difference Function (NSDF) to identify pitch periods through autocorrelation analysis, providing robust fundamental frequency detection in the presence of harmonics and noise.

**Harmonic / Overtone:** Frequency components of a musical sound that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, a note with fundamental 100 Hz contains harmonics at 200 Hz (2nd harmonic), 300 Hz (3rd harmonic), etc.

**Hz (Hertz):** Unit of frequency representing cycles per second. In audio, 440 Hz means the sound wave oscillates 440 times per second.

**JUCE:** A cross-platform C++ framework for developing audio applications, providing abstractions for audio I/O, DSP, GUI, and platform integration. Originally an acronym for "Jules' Utility Class Extensions."

**Just intonation:** A tuning system based on pure integer frequency ratios (e.g., 3:2 for perfect fifth, 5:4 for major third), producing acoustically pure intervals at the cost of key-change complications. Contrasts with equal temperament.

**Latency:** The time delay between an event (e.g., playing a note) and the system's response (e.g., displaying the detected pitch). Low latency (<30 ms) is critical for interactive tuning applications.

**Meter Mode:** The application's operating mode where it continuously monitors microphone input, detects pitch, and displays tuning status with an analog-style meter.

**MIDI note number:** A numerical representation of musical pitches where middle C (C4) = 60, and each semitone increases the number by 1 (C#4 = 61, D4 = 62, etc.). A4 (440 Hz) = 69.

**Octave:** A musical interval where the higher pitch has exactly double the frequency of the lower pitch. Notes separated by one octave have the same name (e.g., A3 at 220 Hz and A4 at 440 Hz).

**NSDF (Normalized Square Difference Function):** A mathematical function used in the McLeod Pitch Period Method to compute autocorrelation with normalization, producing clear peaks at lag values corresponding to the fundamental period of a periodic signal.

**Offline operation:** Application functionality that does not require network connectivity, functioning entirely using local device resources.

**Permission:** Authorization granted by the user allowing an application to access protected resources (microphone, camera, location, etc.). Mobile platforms require explicit user permission for microphone access.

**Pitch:** The perceptual quality of a sound corresponding to its frequency. Higher pitch = higher frequency. In music, pitch is organized into discrete notes (A, B, C, etc.).

**Pitch detection:** The process of analyzing an audio signal to determine its fundamental frequency and identifying the corresponding musical note.

**Pure interval:** A musical interval based on simple integer frequency ratios (e.g., 5:4 for pure major third) rather than equal-tempered approximations. Pure intervals are acoustically consonant but differ slightly from equal-tempered intervals.

**Reference pitch / Reference tone:** A known frequency used as a standard for tuning. In this application, A4 (default 440 Hz) serves as the reference pitch, and the application can generate reference tones for aural tuning.

**Real-time processing:** Computation that must complete within strict time deadlines (audio callback deadlines) to avoid glitches. Real-time audio processing typically occurs in a high-priority thread separate from UI.

**Sample rate:** The number of audio samples captured or generated per second, measured in Hz (typically 44,100 Hz or 48,000 Hz for high-quality audio). Higher sample rates enable representation of higher frequencies.

**Scientific pitch notation:** A system for naming musical pitches using letter names (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) with optional sharps (#) and octave numbers (0-8), where C4 is middle C and A4 is the tuning reference (typically 440 Hz).

**Semitone:** The interval between adjacent notes in the 12-tone equal-tempered scale (e.g., C to C#). One semitone equals 100 cents.

**Sharp / Flat:** Musical notation symbols indicating pitch modification. Sharp (#) raises pitch by one semitone; flat (♭) lowers pitch by one semitone. In tuning, "sharp" means pitch is too high; "flat" means pitch is too low.

**Sine wave:** A smooth, periodic waveform described by the sine function, containing a single frequency with no harmonics. The application generates pure sine waves for reference tones.

**Sound Mode:** The application's operating mode where users select a note and generate a continuous reference tone for aural tuning.

**Touch target:** An interactive user interface element sized for finger-based touch input (minimum 44×44 points on iOS, 48×48 dp on Android).

**Tuner (chromatic tuner):** A device or application that detects the pitch of a musical sound and indicates whether it matches the target frequency (in tune), is too low (flat), or too high (sharp). A chromatic tuner detects all twelve notes rather than being limited to specific instruments.

**UserDefaults (iOS) / SharedPreferences (Android):** Platform-provided mechanisms for storing small amounts of persistent key-value data (preferences) that survive application restarts.

**Data Transformations:**
1. Physical sound → electrical signal → digital samples
2. Time-domain samples → autocorrelation function → NSDF
3. NSDF → fundamental period (peak detection) → fundamental frequency
4. Frequency → note name and octave (logarithmic mapping)
5. Frequency → cent deviation (logarithmic comparison)
6. Cent deviation → tuning status (threshold comparison)
7. Detection results → visual display (UI update)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Steps 1-6 must complete within audio callback deadline (~5-10 ms)
- Autocorrelation and NSDF computation are most computationally intensive steps; optimized implementation critical
- UI update (Step 7) occurs asynchronously to avoid blocking audio thread

**Data Transformations:**
1. User note selection → note enumeration
2. Note enumeration → target frequency (12-TET calculation)
3. Target frequency → sine wave parameters
4. Sine function evaluation → audio samples
5. Digital samples → analog signal → acoustic sound

**Key Parameters:**
- **Amplitude:** Fixed at moderate level (e.g., 0.25 normalized = -12 dBFS)
- **Frequency:** Calculated from reference pitch and note offset
- **Phase:** Accumulated across buffer calls for continuous waveform
- **Sample Rate:** Matches platform (44.1 or 48 kHz)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Sine wave synthesis very efficient (simple arithmetic per sample)
- Phase accumulation must maintain precision to prevent frequency drift
- Fade-in/fade-out envelopes applied when starting/stopping to prevent clicks

**Primary Use Cases:**

**UC-1: Detect Pitch and Display Tuning Status**
- Actor: All user classes
- Precondition: Microphone permission granted
- Main flow: User plays instrument → App detects pitch → Displays note, cent deviation, tuning status
- Postcondition: User knows if instrument is flat, in tune, or sharp

**UC-2: Generate Reference Tone**
- Actor: All user classes
- Precondition: None
- Main flow: User switches to Sound Mode → Selects note → Presses play → Hears reference tone
- Postcondition: User has auditory reference for tuning by ear

**UC-3: Calibrate Reference Pitch**
- Actor: Professional musicians (primarily)
- Precondition: None
- Main flow: User opens Settings → Adjusts reference pitch (A4) → Returns to tuning
- Postcondition: All frequencies recalculated based on new reference

**UC-4: Access Help Documentation**
- Actor: Amateur musicians, educators
- Precondition: None
- Main flow: User taps Help button → Reads explanations → Returns to application
- Postcondition: User better understands concepts (cents, note names, calibration)

**UC-5: Switch Device Orientation**
- Actor: All user classes
- Precondition: None
- Main flow: User rotates device → App redraws UI in new orientation → Functionality preserved
- Postcondition: User continues tuning in preferred orientation

**Actor Relationships:**
- All actors can perform all use cases
- Professional musicians more likely to use UC-3 (calibration)
- Amateur musicians more likely to use UC-4 (help)
- Music educators use all features for teaching demonstrations
