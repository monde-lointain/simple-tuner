# Vision and Scope Document

## SimpleTuner

## 1. Business Requirements

### 1.1 Background

Musical instrument tuning is a fundamental requirement for musicians of all skill levels. While hardware tuners and web-based solutions exist, there is a persistent need for reliable, offline mobile tuner applications that work without internet connectivity. Musicians require accurate pitch detection and reference tones during practice sessions, rehearsals, and performances—often in environments without reliable network access.

The JUCE framework provides cross-platform audio capabilities suitable for developing a professional-grade tuner that maintains consistent behavior across iOS and Android devices while minimizing platform-specific implementation complexity.

### 1.2 Business Opportunity

**BO-1:** Provide a free, high-quality chromatic tuner accessible to musicians worldwide without subscription fees or network requirements.

**BO-2:** Fill the gap for musicians who need offline functionality during travel, outdoor performances, or in locations with limited connectivity.

**BO-3:** Serve both casual musicians who need basic tuning assistance and professional musicians who require precise calibration and reference tone capabilities.

### 1.3 Business Objectives

**OBJ-1:** Release a production-ready chromatic tuner application on iOS and Android app stores within 2 months of project initiation.

**OBJ-2:** Maintain application size under 25 MB to minimize download barriers and device storage requirements.

**OBJ-3:** Ensure 100% offline functionality with zero dependency on network services for core features.

**OBJ-4:** Achieve pitch detection and reference tone generation meeting professional accuracy standards (detection ±1 cent, output ±1.5 cents).

### 1.4 Success Metrics

**SM-1:** Performance: Pitch detection latency under 100ms on 90% of supported devices.

**SM-2:** Stability: Crash rate below 0.5% of user sessions.

**SM-3:** Accuracy validation: Pass blind testing by professional musicians with 95%+ accuracy recognition.

### 1.5 Vision Statement

To provide musicians worldwide with a reliable, accurate, and simple chromatic tuner that works flawlessly offline on mobile devices, eliminating barriers to proper instrument tuning regardless of skill level, location, or network availability.

### 1.5.1 Design Philosophy

SimpleTuner adopts a **measurement instrument on glass** metaphor. The application is designed as a professional tuning instrument—not a consumer lifestyle product. Key design principles:

- **Precision over decoration:** Visual hierarchy favors accuracy and clarity, not aesthetics for their own sake
- **Minimal, intentional interaction:** All controls are deliberate and visible; no hidden gestures or playful animations
- **Restrained feedback:** Visual, motion, and haptic feedback are informational, communicating measurement data—never expressive or attention-seeking
- **Dark, calm environment:** Charcoal/near-black background reduces eye fatigue and lets indicators stand out
- **Immediate trust:** The user understands the interface without exploration or learning; it behaves like a measurement instrument
- **No physical representation:** The entire phone screen is the interface; there is no virtual enclosure or skeuomorphism

This philosophical foundation informs all UI/UX requirements throughout Phases 3-7 of implementation.

### 1.6 Business Risks

**RI-1:** **MEDIUM** - Microphone hardware variability across Android devices may affect pitch detection consistency and require extensive device-specific testing.

**RI-2:** **LOW** - iOS and Android app store approval processes may delay release or require design modifications to meet platform guidelines.

**RI-3:** **MEDIUM** - User expectations shaped by competing applications may lead to feature requests beyond initial scope.

**RI-4:** **LOW** - JUCE framework updates or platform SDK changes may require code maintenance and testing cycles.

**RI-5:** **LOW** - Without monetization strategy, sustained development and support may require volunteer contributions or future business model changes.

**RI-6:** **HIGH** - Background audio restrictions on mobile platforms may limit functionality when application is not in foreground.

### 1.7 Business Assumptions and Dependencies

**AS-1:** Target devices have functional microphones capable of capturing audio in the 32-4186 Hz frequency range with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.

**AS-2:** Target devices have speakers or audio output capable of producing reference tones in the 261-523 Hz range.

**AS-3:** Users will grant microphone permissions required for pitch detection functionality.

**AS-4:** JUCE framework will continue to support iOS and Android platforms throughout development and initial release cycle.

**AS-5:** Development team has access to representative iOS and Android test devices spanning low-end to high-end hardware.

**AS-6:** Musicians understand basic music terminology (note names, cents, reference pitch concepts) or can learn through minimal in-app guidance.

**DE-1:** JUCE framework libraries and licensing terms remain compatible with free application distribution.

**DE-2:** iOS and Android platform APIs for audio input/output remain stable or provide backward compatibility.

**DE-3:** App store distribution platforms (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) remain available and accessible.

### 3.2 Project Priorities

| Priority Dimension | Constraint | Driver | Degree of Freedom |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Features** | | ✓ | |
| **Schedule** | ✓ | | |
| **Budget** | ✓ | | |
| **Quality** | | ✓ | |

**Explanation:**

**Features (Driver):** Core functionality—accurate pitch detection, reference tone generation, and calibration—drives the project's value proposition. These features are non-negotiable and define minimum viable product.

**Schedule (Constraint):** 12-month target release window is constrained by volunteer developer availability and desire to launch before competing solutions saturate market.

**Budget (Constraint):** Free application model with no revenue stream constrains resources to volunteer time and minimal infrastructure costs. No budget for paid development, extensive testing devices, or marketing.

**Quality (Driver):** Accuracy, reliability, and performance directly impact user trust and adoption. Quality standards for pitch detection (±1 cent) and stability are essential drivers that cannot be compromised.

**Priority Guidance:**

- If schedule pressure increases, reduce features to core functionality (MF-1, MF-2, MF-3) and defer secondary features to subsequent releases.
- Quality standards for accuracy and performance must be maintained even if schedule extends.
- Budget constraints are absolute—no paid services or resources can be added.
