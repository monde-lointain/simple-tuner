## 2. Detailed Use Cases

### UC-001: Tune Instrument Using Meter Mode

**Author:** Requirements Engineering Team  
**Date Created:** December 10, 2025

**Primary Actor:** Musician

**Secondary Actors:** 
- Device microphone hardware
- Platform audio input system

**Description:**  
The musician plays their instrument while the application continuously detects the pitch, identifies the note, calculates cent deviation from the target frequency, and displays tuning status through an analog-style meter with visual indicators showing whether the instrument is flat, in tune, or sharp.

**Trigger:**  
Musician launches application (opens in Meter Mode by default) or switches to Meter Mode from Sound Mode.

**Preconditions:**
- Application is installed and launched
- Microphone permission has been granted
- Device microphone is functional
- Application is in foreground

**Postconditions:**
- Musician knows whether instrument is flat, in tune, or sharp
- Musician knows detected note name and octave
- Musician knows precise cent deviation for fine tuning

**Basic Flow:**

1. Musician ensures application is in Meter Mode (default on launch)
2. Musician positions device 30-100 cm from instrument sound source
3. Musician plays single note on instrument
4. Application captures audio through microphone
5. Application analyzes audio using McLeod Pitch Period Method
6. Application identifies fundamental frequency
7. Application maps frequency to nearest chromatic note (C through B with octave 1-8)
8. Application calculates cent deviation from target frequency based on current reference pitch
9. Application updates display showing:
   - Note name and octave (large text, e.g., "A4")
   - Cent deviation value (numeric, e.g., "-12.3 cents")
   - Tuning meter needle position indicating deviation
   - Status indicator ("FLAT", "IN TUNE", or "SHARP")
10. Musician adjusts instrument tuning based on visual feedback
11. Steps 3-10 repeat continuously as musician plays and adjusts
12. When meter shows "IN TUNE" (within ±5 cents), musician stops adjusting

**Alternative Flows:**

**AF-001: Low Signal Level**
- At step 4, if audio level is below -40 dBFS threshold:
  - Application displays "No Signal" or equivalent message
  - Note display shows "—" or "•••"
  - Meter needle remains centered or hidden
  - User moves device closer or plays louder
  - Resume at step 3

**AF-002: Ambiguous Detection**
- At step 6, if multiple frequency candidates have similar confidence:
  - Application rejects detection as unreliable
  - Display shows "No Signal" or inactive state
  - User ensures quieter environment or clearer tone
  - Resume at step 3

**AF-003: Note Change During Sustained Pitch**
- At step 7, if detected note differs from previous detection:
  - Application waits 100ms to confirm new note is stable
  - If confirmed, updates note display
  - If unstable, maintains previous note display
  - Continue with step 8

**AF-004: Reference Pitch Changed Mid-Session**
- Between any steps, if user modifies reference pitch in settings:
  - Application immediately recalculates target frequencies
  - Cent deviation updates based on new reference
  - Continue with current step

**Exceptions:**

**EX-001: Microphone Permission Denied**
- Application detects permission status is "denied"
- Displays message: "Microphone access required for pitch detection"
- Provides "Open Settings" button linking to system settings
- Meter Mode remains inactive until permission granted

**EX-002: Audio System Initialization Failure**
- Audio device fails to initialize at step 4
- Displays error: "Unable to access audio. Please check permissions and restart."
- Provides "Retry" button to attempt reinitialization
- If retry fails, user must restart application

**EX-003: Application Backgrounded**
- If application enters background during any step:
  - Audio processing automatically suspends
  - Display freezes at last known state
  - When returning to foreground, resume at step 3

**EX-004: Excessive Background Noise**
- At step 5, if signal-to-noise ratio insufficient for reliable detection:
  - Application displays "No Signal" or shows highly unstable readings
  - User moves to quieter location
  - Resume at step 3

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Core functionality)

**Business Rules:**

| ID | Rule | Type | Static/Dynamic |
|----|------|------|----------------|
| BR-001 | Detection range must span C1 (32.70 Hz) to C8 (4186.01 Hz) | Constraint | Static |
| BR-002 | Detection accuracy must be within ±1 cent for signals ≥40 dB SNR | Quality | Static |
| BR-003 | Pitch detection latency must not exceed 30ms on 90% of devices | Performance | Static |
| BR-004 | Display update rate must be minimum 20 Hz | Performance | Static |
| BR-005 | "IN TUNE" zone defined as ±5 cents from target frequency | Business Logic | Static |
| BR-006 | Note persistence requires 100ms stability before display change | Business Logic | Static |
| BR-007 | All frequencies calculated based on current reference pitch (A4) | Computation | Dynamic |
| BR-008 | Microphone permission required for Meter Mode operation | Authorization | Static |

**Assumptions:**
- Device microphone has frequency response covering 60-4000 Hz minimum
- User understands basic music terminology (note names) or will consult help
- Ambient noise level permits signal-to-noise ratio ≥40 dB
- User tunes one string/note at a time (monophonic detection only)
- Device has sufficient CPU for real-time autocorrelation processing

**Other Information:**
- Pure interval reference marks at -13.7 cents (pure major third) and +15.6 cents (pure minor third) provide educational reference for historical temperaments
- Professional musicians may prefer numeric cent display; amateur musicians rely more on visual meter and status indicators
- Meter needle uses damping algorithm to reduce jitter while remaining responsive to genuine pitch changes
